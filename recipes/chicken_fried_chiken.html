  <h2>Description</h2>
  <h3>Chicken Fried Chicken is a classic Southern American dish that features a boneless, skinless chicken breast that
    is coated in seasoned flour, fried until golden brown, and typically served with a creamy gravy. Despite its name,
    Chicken Fried Chicken is not the same as traditional fried chicken, as it involves a specific preparation method
    reminiscent of country-fried steak.</h3>
  <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>30 saltine crackers</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons dry potato flakes</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon seasoned salt</li>
    <li>Â½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1 egg</li>
    <li>6 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
    <li>2 cups vegetable oil for frying</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Directions</strong></p>
  <ol>
    <li>Place crackers in a large resealable plastic bag; seal bag and crush crackers with a rolling pin until they are
      coarse crumbs. Add the flour, potato flakes, seasoned salt, and pepper and mix well. </li>
    <li>Beat egg in a shallow dish or bowl. One by one, dredge chicken pieces in egg, then place in bag with crumb
      mixture. Seal bag and shake to coat. </li>
    <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). </li>
    <li>Fry chicken, turning frequently, until golden brown and juices run clear, 15 to 20 minutes. </li>
  </ol>
