# Introduction
Welcome to my project called Odin Recipes, which came about as a result of a challenge from the Odin Project

## Explanation
This project was designed to showcase some of the dishes I like. All three recipes have three sections: 
1.  Description: A brief description of the recipe shown
2. Ingredients: Lists all the ingredients needed to create the dish
3. Directions: This section shows the step-by-step process for creating the dish

## Challenges
In all honesty, I didn't have any difficulty completing this challenge, perhaps because I've had experience with programming before, even though HTML isn't a programming language, having this skill made it a lot easier.
